# Overstory

Retained UI/runtime layer built on top of Understory kernels.

Overstory owns toolkit-facing retained state and runtime policy. It uses
Understory crates for the headless kernels:

- `understory_property` for dependency-style property storage,
- `understory_style` for selector-based style and theme resolution,
- `understory_box_tree` for spatial indexing and hit testing,
- `understory_responder` for deterministic routing helpers,
- `ui-events` for transport-agnostic input event types.

This crate intentionally does **not** define a long-term display-list or
presentation-tree abstraction. The current visual snapshot is a retained,
toolkit-facing debug/projection layer used to pressure-test the runtime shape
until those Understory seam crates exist.

## First slice

The initial crate is deliberately small:

- append-only retained element tree with stable `ElementId`s,
- a built-in element vocabulary (`Root`, `Panel`, `Row`, `Column`, `Button`, `Spacer`),
- built-in layout/visual dependency properties,
- a full rebuild path that resolves style, lays out elements, and projects
  them into an `understory_box_tree::Tree`,
- a `ui-events` pointer runtime that updates hover/press state and emits
  high-level interactions.

## Non-goals

This crate does not yet own:

- text layout,
- accessibility bridges,
- platform event loops,
- a renderer-facing display list,
- a general widget authoring API.

## Example

See `examples/overstory_showcase.rs` in the workspace examples crate.
