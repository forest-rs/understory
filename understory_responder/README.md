Understory Responder: a deterministic, `no_std` router for UI events.

## Overview

This crate builds the responder chain sequence — capture → target → bubble — from pre‑resolved hits.
It does not perform hit testing.
Instead, feed it [`ResolvedHit`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/types/struct.ResolvedHit.html) items (for example from a box tree or a 3D ray cast), and it emits a deterministic propagation sequence you can dispatch.

## Inputs

Provide one or more hit candidates for targets.
The simplest is [`ResolvedHit`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/types/struct.ResolvedHit.html), which contains the node key, an optional owned root→target `path`, a [`DepthKey`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/types/enum.DepthKey.html) used for ordering,
a [`Localizer`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/types/struct.Localizer.html) for coordinate conversion, and an optional `meta` payload (e.g., text or ray‑hit details).

If your picker caches full paths (for example in an `Rc<[K]>`), you can avoid rebuilding a `Vec<K>` by using [`ResolvedHitRef`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/types/struct.ResolvedHitRef.html),
which borrows a `&[K]` path, or by implementing [`Hit`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/types/trait.Hit.html) for your own hit type.
You may also provide a [`ParentLookup`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/types/trait.ParentLookup.html) source to reconstruct a path when `path` is absent.

## Ordering

Candidates are ranked by [`DepthKey`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/types/enum.DepthKey.html).
For `Z`, higher is nearer. For `Distance`, lower is nearer. When kinds differ, `Z` ranks above `Distance` by default.
Equal‑depth ties are stable and the router selects the last.

## Pointer capture

If capture is set, the router routes to the captured node regardless of fresh hits.
It uses the matching hit’s path and `meta` if present, otherwise reconstructs a path with [`ParentLookup`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/types/trait.ParentLookup.html) or falls back to a singleton path.
Capture bypasses scope filtering.

## Layering

The router only computes the traversal order. A higher‑level dispatcher can execute handlers, honor cancelation, and apply toolkit policies.

## Workflow

1) Pick candidates — e.g., from a 2D box tree or a 3D ray cast — and build
   one or more [`ResolvedHit`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/types/struct.ResolvedHit.html) values (with optional root→target paths).
2) Route — [`Router`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/router/struct.Router.html) ranks candidates by [`DepthKey`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/types/enum.DepthKey.html) and selects
   exactly one target. It emits a capture→target→bubble sequence for that target’s path.
   - Overlapping siblings: only the topmost/nearest candidate is selected; siblings do not receive the target.
   - Equal‑depth ties: deterministic and stable; the last candidate wins unless you pre‑order your hits or set a policy.
   - Pointer capture: overrides selection until released.

## Integration with Event State

The router produces dispatch sequences that integrate with `understory_event_state` for stateful interactions:

- Extract root→target paths using [`path_from_dispatch`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/router/fn.path_from_dispatch.html)
- Feed paths to hover, focus, click, and drag state managers as needed
- See `understory_event_state` documentation for details on each state manager

## Focus Routing

Focus routing is separate from pointer routing.
Use [`Router::dispatch_for`](router::Router::dispatch_for) to emit a capture → target → bubble sequence for a focused node.
The router reconstructs the root→target path via [`ParentLookup`](https://docs.rs/understory_responder/latest/understory_responder/types/trait.ParentLookup.html) or falls back to a singleton path.
Keyboard and IME events typically route to focus and may bypass scope filters by policy at a higher layer.

## Dispatcher

Execute handlers over the responder sequence and honor stop/cancelation with [`dispatcher::run`].

```rust
use understory_responder::dispatcher;
use understory_responder::types::{Dispatch, Outcome, Phase};
let mut default_prevented = false;
let stop_at = dispatcher::run(&seq, &mut default_prevented, |d, flag| {
    if matches!(d.phase, Phase::Target) {
        *flag = true;
    }
    Outcome::Continue
});
assert!(stop_at.is_none());
assert!(default_prevented);
```

See the `dispatcher` module docs for additional patterns and helpers.

## Adapters

The [`adapters`] module provides integration with other Understory crates:

- **Box Tree Adapter** (`box_tree_adapter` feature): Converts [`understory_box_tree`] spatial queries
  into [`ResolvedHit`](types::ResolvedHit) items. Includes filtered tree traversal for keyboard navigation.

This crate is `no_std` and uses `alloc`.
