#![no_std]

//! Understory Timing: host-agnostic timer queue primitives.
//!
//! This crate provides a small, deterministic core for ordering timers by
//! monotonic deadlines. It is intended for UI toolkits, event loops, and other
//! host runtimes that want timer bookkeeping without taking on clocks, threads,
//! async reactors, callbacks, or platform wakeups.
//!
//! The core concepts are:
//!
//! - [`TimerInstant`] and [`TimerDuration`]: host-provided integer ticks. Most
//!   hosts use nanoseconds, but the queue treats them as opaque monotonic
//!   labels.
//! - [`TimerQueue`]: a deadline-ordered queue of pending timers.
//! - [`TimerId`]: the queue-assigned id used for queue-local cancellation and
//!   delivery recognition.
//! - [`TimerRepeat`]: the policy for calculating a repeating timer's next
//!   deadline.
//! - [`ExpiredTimer`]: an owned record returned to the host once a timer is due.
//!
//! This crate deliberately does **not** know about wall-clock time, sleeping,
//! wakeup registration, async tasks, widgets, rendering, or redraw policy. Host
//! runtimes are responsible for:
//!
//! - converting their clock into [`TimerInstant`] and [`TimerDuration`] values,
//! - calling [`TimerQueue::schedule`] / [`TimerQueue::schedule_once`] for
//!   relative delays, and [`TimerQueue::schedule_at`] /
//!   [`TimerQueue::schedule_once_at`] for host-computed absolute deadlines,
//! - using [`TimerQueue::next_deadline`] to arm the host wakeup mechanism,
//! - storing callback or action state in or alongside the timer target payload,
//! - calling [`TimerQueue::pop_expired`] with the current monotonic time when
//!   the host wakes,
//! - dispatching each owned expired record to the owner identified by
//!   [`ExpiredTimer::target`],
//! - calling [`TimerQueue::rearm`] after dispatch if a repeating timer should
//!   keep running,
//! - using [`TimerQueue::retain_pending`] when an owner is removed and all of
//!   its pending timers should be purged.
//!
//! The queue is backed by a sorted [`alloc::collections::VecDeque`]. It favors a
//! small dependency-free core and explicit ordering rules over high-volume timer
//! scheduling machinery. It is a good fit for the modest timer counts common in
//! UI toolkits and small runtime loops; hosts with very large timer sets can
//! layer a heap or timing wheel above a different scheduling core.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! - Pending timers are stored in deadline order.
//! - Timers with equal deadlines fire in scheduling order.
//! - Timer ids are stable for the timer record, including after expiration.
//! - Cancellation is idempotent, applies to pending timers, and reports whether
//!   a pending timer was removed.
//! - Expired timers are removed before they are returned to the host.
//! - Relative deadline arithmetic saturates at [`u64::MAX`].
//!
//! ## Cancellation and delivery
//!
//! [`TimerQueue::cancel`] removes pending timers only. Once a timer has been
//! returned by [`TimerQueue::pop_expired`], it is no longer pending; hosts that
//! batch expired timers before dispatch may still deliver that already-drained
//! record. Owners should compare the delivered [`TimerId`] with their current
//! stored id or token and ignore stale deliveries.
//!
//! Repeating timers make rearm explicit for the same reason. To cancel a
//! repeating timer that has already expired, drop the [`ExpiredTimer`] instead
//! of passing it to [`TimerQueue::rearm`].
//!
//! ## Target payloads
//!
//! Timer targets are host-defined owner handles. Use ids such as element,
//! widget, task, connection, or request ids when possible. Expired timers own
//! their target handle so the queue is not borrowed while the host dispatches
//! the timer.
//!
//! ## Minimal example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use understory_timing::TimerQueue;
//!
//! let mut timers = TimerQueue::new();
//! let button = 42_u32;
//! let id = timers.schedule_once(button, 1_000, 250);
//!
//! assert_eq!(timers.next_deadline(), Some(1_250));
//!
//! let timer = timers.pop_expired(1_250).expect("timer is due");
//!
//! assert_eq!(timer.id(), id);
//! assert_eq!(*timer.target(), button);
//! assert!(timers.is_empty());
//! ```
//!
//! ## External timer tokens
//!
//! Host runtimes that already expose their own timer token type can store that
//! token in the target payload. The queue's [`TimerId`] remains useful for
//! diagnostics or queue-local cancellation, while the host token remains the
//! value returned from higher-level APIs:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use understory_timing::TimerQueue;
//!
//! #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
//! struct AppTimerToken(u64);
//!
//! #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
//! struct TimerTarget {
//!     token: AppTimerToken,
//!     window: u32,
//! }
//!
//! let mut timers = TimerQueue::new();
//! let delivered = AppTimerToken(7);
//! let cancelled = AppTimerToken(8);
//!
//! timers.schedule_once(
//!     TimerTarget {
//!         token: delivered,
//!         window: 1,
//!     },
//!     1_000,
//!     250,
//! );
//! timers.schedule_once(
//!     TimerTarget {
//!         token: cancelled,
//!         window: 1,
//!     },
//!     1_000,
//!     500,
//! );
//!
//! let removed = timers.retain_pending(|timer| timer.target().token != cancelled);
//! assert_eq!(removed, 1);
//!
//! let expired = timers.pop_expired(1_250).expect("timer is due");
//! let target = expired.into_target();
//!
//! assert_eq!(target.token, delivered);
//! assert_eq!(target.window, 1);
//! ```
