Renderer-neutral motion primitives.

This crate owns value interpolation, easing, color interpolation,
single-value transitions, decomposed transform data, and basic physics
sampling. It explicitly does not own UI elements, dependency properties,
style resolution, invalidation, layout, or composition backends.

Use this crate when an animation, transition, or gesture recognizer needs
pure value math without taking a dependency on a renderer or UI runtime.
The core traits are [`Interpolate`] for pairwise interpolation and
[`AnimatableValue`] for values that can also participate in additive or
accumulative animation stacks.

## Minimal example

```rust
use understory_motion::{TimingFunction, Transition};

let transition = Transition::new(0.0_f64, 10.0, 0, 100, TimingFunction::LINEAR);
let eased = transition.sample(25);

assert_eq!(eased, 2.5);
```

## Boundary

`understory_motion` treats durations, colors, transforms, and scalar
values as already chosen by a higher-level system. It does not resolve
style, store properties, drive frame clocks, interpret input events, or
submit renderer commands.

This crate is `no_std` by default. The default `libm` feature forwards to
dependent math and color crates so ordinary builds work without `std`.
Enable the `std` feature when an application wants standard-library
support instead.
