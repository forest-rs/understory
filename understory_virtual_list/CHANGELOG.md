# Changelog

The latest published Understory Virtual List release is [0.1.1](#011-2026-05-17) which was released on 2026-05-17.
You can find its changes [documented below](#011-2026-05-17).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `IndexStrip`, `IndexStrip::range`, `IndexStrip::covered_extent`,
  `compute_materialized_strip`, `VirtualList::viewport_strip`, and
  `VirtualList::viewport_range` for half-open materialized and viewport ranges.
  ([#169][] and [#171][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
- Added `VirtualList::set_len` for resizable models, `ResizableExtentModel` for
  `TailAnchoredExtentModel`, and model query wrappers on `VirtualList` that do
  not invalidate its cached materialized strip. ([#170][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
- Added `VirtualList::materialized_strip`, `VirtualList::materialized_range`,
  `VirtualList::materialized_indices`, `VirtualList::first_materialized_index`,
  and `VirtualList::last_materialized_index` for the overscanned range that host
  code should instantiate. ([#171][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])

### Deprecated

- Deprecated `VirtualList::visible_strip`, `VirtualList::visible_indices`,
  `VirtualList::first_visible_index`, and `VirtualList::last_visible_index`;
  these names implied viewport visibility, but their results include overscan.
  ([#171][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
- Deprecated `VisibleStrip`, `VisibleStrip::visible_extent`, and
  `compute_visible_strip`; these names implied viewport visibility, but the
  result may include overscan. ([#171][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])

## [0.1.1][] (2026-05-17)

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.88.

### Added

- Added `VirtualList::restore_tail_anchor`, a convenience helper for applying a
  tail-anchor state captured before mutating the model. ([#165][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
- Implemented `ResizableExtentModel` for `SparsePrefixSumExtentModel`. ([#166][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])

### Deprecated

- Deprecated `VirtualList::stick_to_tail_if_anchored`; it checks anchoring after
  the model has changed, which can miss append/update cases that were anchored
  before mutation. ([#165][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])

### Fixed

- Fixed empty visible-strip spacer metadata when the requested range is at or
  beyond the end of the content. ([#165][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
